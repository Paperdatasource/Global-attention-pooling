The code on global attention pooling (GAP). It can be used into a generator transient assessment scheme (GTSA) in the power system.
Fig. 1 descride the difference between GAP-based GTSA scheme and other scheme. Fig. 3 describes the proposed GAP-GL scheme to deal with GTSA. Fig. 4 demonstrates the detailed structure of GAP.
